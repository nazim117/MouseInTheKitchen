# MouseInTheKitchen
A small app that virtually represents a mouse in a cupboard trying to find some cheese to eat. It has to avoid traps, otherwise the mouse will be caught and the program will stop. If the mouse gets outside of the cupboard the application stops again. "@" sign serves the purpose of a wall which if reached does not let the mouse move. It applies 2 dimensional array to represent the cupboard. Uses commands such as: 
"up", "down", "left", "right" in order for the movement to be done.
